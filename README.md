# forcedirectedgraph

Free Code Camp force directed graph data visualization project.

This project shows the relationship between news posts and writers on the FCC website. The blue spheres are the blog urls and the images are the writers. Bigger nodes / pictures mean more posts. You can adjust the "charge" and the "gravity" to change the relative positioning of the nodes.

D3 and JavaScript.
